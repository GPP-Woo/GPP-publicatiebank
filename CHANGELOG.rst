2.0.0 (2025-09-01)
==================

Major feature release - continue reading for the breaking changes.

Upgrade procedure
-----------------

⚠️ We bumped the major version because some of the changes are technically breaking
changes, which affect GPP-app and equivalent alternatives. GPP-burgerportaal should not
be affected. You will need GPP-app 3.x or newer.

No manual actions are needed.

Breaking changes
----------------

* Bumped the major version of the API to ``v2``. All the endpoints moved to the
  ``/api/v2`` URL prefix. We *also* still serve the endpoints under the ``/api/v1``
  prefix to make transitioning easier, but this is undocumented and deprecated. Most
  likely we'll remove this in the next feature release.

* The publication status field of the ``Publicatie`` and ``Document`` resource now has
  restrictions in the allowed state transitions. Before 2.0.0, you could change the
  ``publicatiestatus`` to any possible status, which now is no longer possible. The
  allowed state transitions are documented in the API specification.

* Removed ``documenthandelingen`` - the information can be extracted from the new date
  and datetime fields on ``Document``.

* Changed built-in group names - update your OpenID Connect role/group names accordingly.

    * ``Functioneel Beheer`` -> ``FunctioneelBeheer``
    * ``Technisch Beheer`` -> ``TechnischBeheer``


Features
--------

* [:issue:`361`] The new date fields ``gepubliceerd_op``, ``datum_begin_geldigheid``
  and ``datum_einde_geldigheid`` are now also sent to the search index for indexing.
* [:issue:`349`] When the ``publisher`` changes on a publication, the ``bronorganisatie`` in the underlying
  Documents API storage is now updated for the documents belonging to the publication.
* [:issue:`367`] The admin panel UI for related documents within a publication is simplified.
* [:issue:`364`, :issue:`365` :issue:`366`] Improved the field organization for publications, documents and topics in the admin.
* [:issue:`363`] The deprecated `identifier` field is no longer displayed in the document list in the admin.
* [:issue:`295`] You can now update ``Document.creatiedatum`` via the API.
* [:issue:`266`] The ``Publicatie`` and ``Document`` publication status progressions now have a
  well-documented life cycle. The API validates that these status changes are
  meaningfull.
* [:issue:`214`, :issue:`215`] You can now configure a pattern for the URLs to a publication in the
  internal application (GPP-app) and public citizen portal (GPP-burgerportaal). These
  URLs are included in the API responses for publications.
* [:issue:`275`] You can now add (custom) descriptions to information categories in the
  metadata loaded from overheid.nl value lists.
* [:issue:`270`] You can now add the RSIN to organisations in the metadata loaded from
  overheid.nl value lists.
* [:issue:`194`] You can now add (additional) ``identifiers`` ("kenmerken") to documents. Any
  specified identifiers are also indexed in GPP-zoeken.
* [:issue:`195`] You can now add (additional) ``identifiers`` ("kenmerken") to publications. Any
  specified identifiers are also indexed in GPP-zoeken.
* [:issue:`263`] Added support for "concept" publications with incomplete data. The validation
  requirements are relaxed since a lot of information may be unknown in automated
  publishing architectures. The validation is enforced when the publication status
  changes from ``concept``.
* [:issue:`304`] You can now delete documents via the API. The delete cascades to the underlying
  Documenten API and destroys the metadata and content there.
* [:issue:`282`] Added new metadata date/datetime fields:

    * Publication: published on, revoked on, start date, end date.
    * Document: received on, signed on, published on, revoked on.

* [:issue:`320`] Changed the built-in user group names to remove spaces, for better
  compatibility with role names in MS Entra.
* [:issue:`283`] The archiving parameters are now calculated when a publication is published
  rather than when it's created.
* [:issue:`272`] Update the value for ``auteur`` in the Documenten API for documents that we
  register.
* [:issue:`319`] Support filtering in the API on identifiers ("kenmerken", value and/or source).
* [:issue:`274`] API clients can now provide a link to a resource in a Documents API instead of
  uploading the metadata and file parts content.
* [:issue:`271`] The RSIN of the related publisher (organisation) is now used when the document
  metadata is registered in the Documents API. If none is available, the global default
  is used as was the situation before.


Bugfixes
--------

* [:issue:`307`, :issue:`311`] Fixed container restarts overwriting custom archiving parameters set on
  information categories.
* [:issue:`298`] Fixed changes to ``publisher`` and/or ``informatieCategorieen`` on a
  publication not triggering document re-indexing for the related documents.
* [:issue:`330`] Revoked publications are now excluded from the choices in the admin when
  adding a document.
* [:issue:`309`] Fixed not always deleting the document from the Documents API when a document
  is deleted from GPP-publicatiebank.

Project maintenance
-------------------

* Replaced the CI pipeline for quality control on the OpenAPI specification with a
  reusable variant.
* Updated frontend dependencies (security fixes).
* Replaced boilerplate utilities with their equivalents from maykin-common.
* Upgraded external packages to their latest (security) releases.
* Removed the unused Javascript toolchain.
* Updated github issue templates.
* [:issue:`292`] Removed ``documenthandelingen``.
* [:issue:`340`] Deprecated ``identifier`` on the ``Document`` resource, use ``kenmerken``
  instead.
* Application logs are now structured (JSON) using ``structlog``.
* Updated project documentation.

  Added support for archive parameters and retention policies:

    * The archive action date of publications is automatically calculated.
    * You can manually override these parameters if needed.
    * Relevant filters on API endpoints have been added.
    * Added bulk actions in the admin to reassess the retention policy.
