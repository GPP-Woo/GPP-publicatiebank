WOO Publications
================

The Dutch government wishes to be open and transparent to its citizens. To achieve this,
the law "Wet open overheid (WOO)" was established, requiring government organisations to
actively and digitally publish their documents.

The WOO Publication base provides a storage repository and JSON API to manage and expose
such publications and related documents.

This registration component is designed in line with the `Common Ground`_ model.

This project is and only uses :ref:`introduction_open-source`.
