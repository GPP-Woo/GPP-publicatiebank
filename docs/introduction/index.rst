Introduction
============

The Dutch government wishes to be open and transparent to its citizens. To achieve this,
the law "Wet open overheid (WOO)" was established, requiring government organisations to
actively and digitally publish their documents.

The WOO Publication base provides a storage repository and JSON API to manage and expose
such publications and related documents.

For a full publication platform, additional components are required:

* WOO Publications, a dedicated interface for creating, drafting and managing
  publications and related documents.
* WOO Search, a component responsible for indexing public publications.
* WOO Citizen Portal, a component allowing citizens to browse and search through
  publications.

The team behind WOO Publication provides
`implementations <https://github.com/GeneriekPublicatiePlatformWoo>`_ for each of those
components.
