Services
========

GPP-Publicatiebank is designed to operate in a micro-service environment, which broadly
means that it talks to other APIs to be able to function correctly - see
:ref:`installation_requirements` for some more background information and things that
need to be arranged in those external services.

The services configuration in GPP-Publicatiebank stores the connection and
authentication details for those external services.

General instructions
--------------------

To view and manage services, navigate to **Admin** > **Configuration** > **Services**.

The list shows an overview of configured services, displaying the label/name, the kind
of service and the base URL where it is hosted.

In the top right of the page, you can click the **Service toevoegen** button to add a
new service. To edit an existing service, click its label, which takes you to the
edit page.

.. _configuration_services_documents_api:

Documents API configuration
---------------------------

GPP-Publicatiebank depends on the
`Documents API <https://vng-realisatie.github.io/gemma-zaken/standaard/documenten/>`_.

What you'll need
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The API root URL, e.g. ``https://api.example.com/documenten/api/v1/``
* API credentials: a client ID and secret
* RSIN of the organisation that will own the documents in the Documents API. Typically
  this will be the RSIN of your municipality.

Configuration in the registration component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Navigate to the **Admin** environment.
2. In the menu, navigate to **Configuration** > **Services**.
3. Click the **Add service** button in the top right of the screen.
4. Fill out the form fields:

    - ``Label``: a label so you can recognize the service in a choice list, e.g. "Documents API".
    - ``Type``: select "DRC (Informatieobjecten)"
    - ``API root URL``: enter the obtained base URL of the API, e.g.
      ``https://api.example.com/documenten/api/v1/`` from the examples in the previous
      section.

      in the previous section.

5. Save the changes.

configured for this. If no service is configured, indexing operations will be skipped.

What you'll need
