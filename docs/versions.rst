Versioning
==========

Policy
------

GPP-Publicatiebank (and the associated API spefication) adheres to
`semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_, meaning major versions may introduce
breaking changes and minor versions are backwards compatible. Release notes for each
version are documented in the :ref:`changelog`.

The version of the backend and its API specification are not guaranteed to be the same -
bugfixes and improvements can result in a newer version of the backend compared to the
shipped API specification. A version bump in the API specification always implies a
version bump of the backend.

Backend and API
---------------

The backend contains the storage and exposes the API.
